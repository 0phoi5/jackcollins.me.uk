      <description>Background Usage Examples Cheatsheet Official Documentation Drawbacks Similar Tools   Background Nmap, or &amp;lsquo;Network Mapper&amp;rsquo;, was originally conceived in 1997 by Gordon Lyon, included as an article in Phrack Magazine along with it&amp;rsquo;s source code. The community at the time were so impressed with it&amp;rsquo;s early capabilities, it was taken up as a collaberative project by the tech community, and remains so right up until today.
Since it&amp;rsquo;s initial creation, Nmap has gone through many big updates, each adding more capabilities.</description>
