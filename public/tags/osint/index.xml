      <description>During pentesting, specifically during pre-engagement OSINT, we&amp;rsquo;ll want to make use of various social media websites to gather information about our target.
This page is dedicated to listing specific details about some of the major social media sites, and how to go about gathering data from them.
Note: Intelligence X Tools are good for a number of these sites.
  LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Instagram Snapchat Reddit Tiktok Telegram   LinkedIn Of note is the fact that you wonâ€™t be able to see as much information about someone if you are a third+ connection to them.</description>
