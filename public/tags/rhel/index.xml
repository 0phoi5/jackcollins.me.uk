      <description>What are Huge Pages? Checking the current status of Huge Pages How do I amend Huge Pages on a RHEL server? Calculating Huge Pages Miscellaneous notes on Huge Pages   What are Huge Pages? Systems with large amounts of RAM may mean Huge Pages need to be implemented.

      <description>Amazon Workspaces is a brilliant offering by AWS to allow users access to Windows 10 (or Amazon Linux) based Virtual Machines in the cloud, from anywhere in the world. Unlike EC2, it much more easily scales up for companies to allow remote and cloud based, Active-Directory integrated fleets of VMs for employees. However we can also use it on an individual scale to give access to a true Windows 10 box (not Windows server 2019) from anywhere in the World, without the need for using local CPU, RAM and disk resources for the VM.</description>
