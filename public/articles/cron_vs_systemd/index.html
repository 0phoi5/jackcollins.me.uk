<h2 id="whatiscron">What are Cron Jobs?</h2>
<p>Cron is a job scheduler that has been around on Unix based operating systems for a long time.<br>
It is used to run commads or scripts at specific intervals of time, for example backing up a server via a shell script every Thursday at 9pm.</p>
<p>Cron uses something called the <em>crontab</em>, or <em>Command Run On Table</em>, to store it&rsquo;s jobs, usually located under <em>/var/spool/cron/</em>. Each user has their own crontab and cron jobs, and the jobs run as that user, with that user&rsquo;s permissions and abilities.</p>
<p>Cron has been around a very long time, and some of it&rsquo;s advantages are that it is available on almost every Unix-based system (Linux being based on Unix) as well as the fact that it is really simple to learn and use.</p>
<p>Cron uses the <em>crontab</em> command to <strong>e</strong>dit and <strong>l</strong>ist Cron Jobs;</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ crontab -e
</code></pre><p>The format is;</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>* * * * * command
- - - - -
| | | | |
| | | | +----- Day of the week (0-6, Sunday is 0)
| | | +------- Month (1-12)
| | +--------- Day of the month (1-31)
| +----------- Hour (0-23)
+------------- Minute (0-59)
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ crontab -l

# Run a backup every Thursday at 9pm
0 21 * * 4 /directoy/backup.sh
</code></pre><p>The Cron service will then check the contents of the crontab every minute, running any commands/scripts that are scheduled for the current system time.</p>
<p>You can also have cron jobs run at a specific event taking place, such as after system boot.</p>
<p>On modern Linux systems, there is a better alternative now available that should be considered; Systemd Timers.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whatissystemd">What are Systemd Timers?</h2>
<p>Systemd timers are similar to cron jobs, in the way that they run specific commands or scripts at set intervals or after specific events take place like system boot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably already familiar with systemd&rsquo;s administrator-owned (writable) unit files, stored in <em>/etc/systemd/system</em>. Well, systemd timers are stored in the same location, with the extension <em>.timer</em>.<br>
You can view all timers that are currently in place using <code>systemd status *timer</code>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll cover the creation of a new systemd timer below.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why">Why use Systemd over Cron?</h2>
<p>There are a few good reasons to use systemd timers over cron jobs;</p>
<ol>
<li>Systemd timers can be configured in a similar way to unit files; <strong>dependencies can be defined</strong>. This means we can wait for specific conditions to be in place before the timer triggers, such as certain services running.</li>
<li><strong>Failure handling</strong> is available, meaning that if a job fails then we can define conditions for it to be tried again.</li>
<li>Systemd timers have <strong>built-in logging</strong>, so we can easily track when a timer last ran and whether it was successful, something not readily available in cron without manually adding to our scripts.</li>
<li><strong>More options</strong> are available, without us having to add them in to scripts called by cron, such as randomised delays and tighter timer accuracry (cron is limited to full minutes only)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also a couple of considerations;</p>
<ol>
<li>Cron is widely available on pretty much all Linux distributions. Whilst systemd is available on <em>most</em> systems, it may not be available everywhere, especially on older platforms such as HP-UX.</li>
<li>Overhead may be something to consider; whilst systemd offers a lot of great new features over cron, if none of them are needed, it may be easier to stick to cron. Although, personally, I can&rsquo;t think of a scenario where proper logging of jobs and decent failure handling wouldn&rsquo;t be a bonus, but maybe not everyone would feel the same.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="example">Systemd Timer Example</h2>
<p>To set up a systemd timer;</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a systemd .service file, for this example <em>/etc/systemd/system/example.service</em>;</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[Unit]
Description=Example Timer Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/path/to/your/script.sh
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
</code></pre><p><strong>Type=oneshot</strong> defines that the service should exit before systemd starts follow-up units.<br>
<strong>Restart=on-failure</strong> ensures that if the service fails, it will be restarted.<br>
<strong>RestartSec=5</strong> is the time to sleep before restarting.<br>
<strong>StandardOutput</strong> and <strong>StandardError</strong> define where the service&rsquo;s logs will go. If you stick to <em>journal</em> (recommended) then you can view these logs using <code>journalctl -u example.service</code>. This gives you an easy method of seeing when a service last ran and whether it was successful, or if not then give you errors you can work with to resolve issues.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Create a .timer file, in this example */etc/systemd/system/example.timer;</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[Unit]
Description=Example Timer

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 00:00:00

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
</code></pre><p><strong>OnCalendar</strong> sets when the timer should trigger. In the above, it triggers daily at midnight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE :</strong> Systemd timers use the same file name between .service and .timer files, to link them up. So <em>example.timer</em> would link to <em>example.service</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>If you need a task to run after a specific dependency (e.g., network.target), you can specify that in the <strong>After</strong> option in the service file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After creating both files as above, reload the systemd daemon and enable/start your timer;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload</code><br>
<code>sudo systemctl enable example.timer</code><br>
<code>sudo systemctl start example.timer</code></p>
